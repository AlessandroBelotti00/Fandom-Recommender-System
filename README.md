# Fandom-Recommender-System

The task is to build a system to recommend similar articles based on what users have read before. Skills needed include web scraping, text processing, and data retrieval. The challenge is creating an algorithm that analyzes user preferences and suggests relevant content.

The main phases of the algorithm are the following:

1) **Crawling and scraping** - Download text from hundred fandom wiki articles.
2) **Stemming, lemmatization** - preprocess downloaded documents into the most suitable form for this
task. Store it as a .csv file.
3) **Similarities** - for a given collection of previously visited articles find the best matches in your
database and recommend them to the use
